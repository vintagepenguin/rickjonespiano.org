        <h2>about rick.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Rick has taught over 70,000+ private lessons in 26+ years of teaching. <strong><u>At one point, Rick was teaching close to 5,000 piano lessons a year.</u> </strong>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>He's taught students as young as 4 and as old as 80. It's never too late to learn.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Rick is certified by the National Music Teacher's Association. He is also certified in the famous Suzuki method. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Rick has worked with some of the best pianists in the world, and shares that experience with everyone he teachers.</p>

      <div  id="signup" class="content-block two">

        <h2>sign up.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Signing up is simple.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Call Rick at <u>801-731-0391</u> to check for availability.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Rick teaches students Monday-Saturday. He starts as early as 7am and has taught as late as 9pm. </p> 
        <br>
        <p>Lessons are taught at Rick's piano studio at his home in West Haven.</p>

      <div id="how" class="content-block three">
        <h2>how it works.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Each week, students get a 30 minute private lesson from Rick. Students are expected to practice 4-6 times per week.</p>
        <br>
        <p><u>Rick charges by the month. It's $64 per month which works out to be $16 per lesson.</u></p>
        <br>
        <p>Students are also invited to play at recitals which Rick hosts. Playing at recitals is encouraged. It's a great way to practice performing and let others see the progress you've made.</p>
        <br>
         <p>With his experience, Rick could charge much more, but prefers to keep it affordable so that more people can learn the instrument he loves. </p>
